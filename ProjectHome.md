A simple stopping watch for Android

Just download the .apk Package and put it on your phone! When you have installed a previous version from Anstop on your phone and have difficulties to install it, try adb uninstall An.stop and after adb install Anstopvx.x.apk (x stands for the version number)

**The easier way** is to download the .apk file with your phone and install Anstop right on it. If you get an error please uninstall a previous version of Anstop first.

But please read and accept the license before you are using Anstop!
